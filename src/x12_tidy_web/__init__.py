"""x12-tidy-web: a web front end for the x12-tidy validator/repairer.

A visitor pastes a (possibly malformed) ANSI X12 interchange into a form. The
server runs :func:`x12_tidy.tidy` on it, feeds the cleansed payload back in, and
repeats until the result stops changing or comes back clean -- an *iterative*
repair. Every pass is recorded, so the visitor sees not just the final corrected
string but what each round fixed, and can download the whole run as a report in
the format they choose.

The only external dependency that matters is :mod:`x12_tidy`. Everything x12-tidy
knows about X12 lives there; this package adds the loop, the report renderers,
and the HTTP layer.
